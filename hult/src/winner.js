                Korion Health is creating a home health monitoring kit that puts healthcare in the palm of a patient’s hand, regardless of cost, disability, or distance. Korion’s flagship product is an electronic stethoscope, the SoundHeart system, that enables patients to collect their own heart and lung sounds. The handheld device and its companion app helps patients find the correct placement of the stethoscope for accurate results. Patients can use the stethoscope at their convenience and send the recordings to their physician for analysis.
                <br></br>
                Up to 80% of deaths from heart disease are preventable with early intervention and screening. While modern telemedicine has increased patients’ ability to consult with healthcare professionals, current solutions for performing remote screenings are costly and lack a stethoscope. By partnering with existing telemedicine companies to bring the cardiopulmonary exam into patients’ homes, Korion Health is revolutionizing virtual care. Korion’s mission makes these life-saving screenings as accessible and affordable as possible while empowering patients to better understand and monitor their health from the comfort of their own homes.
